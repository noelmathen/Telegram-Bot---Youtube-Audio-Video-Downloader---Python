Project Description:
YouTube Downloader Telegram Bot
The YouTube Downloader Telegram Bot is a Python-based bot that allows users to download YouTube videos and playlists directly from Telegram. With this bot, users can conveniently fetch videos in either mp4 (video) or mp3 (audio) format, depending on their preference.

Key Features:
Single Video Download: Users can provide a valid YouTube video link, and the bot will download the video in 360p resolution as an mp4 file.
Single Audio Download: Users can request audio-only versions of YouTube videos, which will be downloaded as mp3 files.
Playlist Video Download: The bot can handle YouTube playlist links, downloading all the videos in the playlist as mp4 files in 360p resolution.
Playlist Audio Download: Users can also download all the audio tracks from a YouTube playlist, which will be saved as mp3 files.
Usage and Limitations:
The bot supports video downloads for YouTube links with resolutions up to 360p.
Videos or playlists exceeding 8 minutes in length cannot be downloaded due to size limitations (maximum 30MB per file).
For playlist downloads, the bot will send each video or audio as individual files.
Note: This project is intended for educational and personal use only. Respect copyright laws and the terms of service of YouTube while using the bot. The bot may not work as expected if the YouTube link structure changes in the future.

Feel free to deploy this YouTube Downloader Telegram Bot and enjoy the convenience of downloading videos and audio files directly from Telegram!
